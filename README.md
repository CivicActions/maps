# Maps
A place to hold and centralize various mapping and definition files.

TODO: Standard mapping schema, YAML? and then a workflow job that renders the mapping files into a pretty static site that has links to json, xml, yaml, csv, whatever other machine readable formats people want so they can easily map things.
